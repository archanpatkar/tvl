This library provides the user with operations of Non - Classical Trivalent or Three Valued Logic. Three valued logic is a multivalued logic i.e. it has more than two truth values in contrast to Propositional Logic which has only true and false. Three valued logic introduces a third type of assertion `undefined` or `inderminate`. The fundamental operations remain the same to and draw a parallel with Propositional operations.
