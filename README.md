This library provides the user with all the standard Propsitional Logic like operations of Non - Classical Trivalent or Three Valued Logic. This is an implementation of Kleene's (strong) "logic of indeterminacy" and Priest's "logic of paradox". Three valued logic is a multivalued logic i.e. it has more than two truth values in contrast to Propositional Logic which has only true and false, it introduces a third type of assertion undefined or indeterminate which allows the logic system to capture a fuzzy world view. The fundamental operations remain the same but the semantic understanding and logical implications change when compared to Propositional operations. The distribution of the library has a very small footprint, only 316 Bytes (Min + Gzip).
